###AmazonChallenge

##Description
AmazonChallenge is a project that implements a service for generating word clouds based on product descriptions from Amazon. This service leverages **CompletableFuture** to perform asynchronous operations, improving the application's efficiency and scalability. Through a crawler, the description of an Amazon product is obtained, and a word cloud generator processes this description to calculate word frequencies and send it to the Front-End.

#Amazon Crawler: A component that fetches the description of an Amazon product based on a product URL.
#Word Cloud Generator: A component that processes a product description to calculate word frequencies.
#Word Cloud Service: A service that uses the crawler and generator to fetch a product description and generate a word cloud asynchronously, taking advantage of CompletableFuture.
